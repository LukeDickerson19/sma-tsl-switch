# SMA TSL SWITCH

#### Description:

Switch back and forth between a long and short TSL (Trailing Stop Loss), just tracking not investing.

When SMA is going up, invest in the long TSL,

and when SMA is going down invest in the short TSL.

This strategy is very similar to the Parabolic SAR trading strategy,

but uses the SMA slope to attempt to avoid the situations where SAR takes a loss.


#### Results:

The backtest results say the strategy has a 15x annual return, but I think this is too good to be true. I've been looking into the way I'm calculating profits and it seems to be accurate though.
