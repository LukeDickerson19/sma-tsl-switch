STRATEGY DESCRIPTION:

    Switch back and forth between a long and short TSL (just tracking, no investment).
    When SMA is going up, invest in the long TSL,
    and when SMA is going down invest in the short TSL.

EXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION:

    for each coin in COINS:
        for each sma window length w in SMA_WINDOWS:

            high-light when the sma is + slope and when its - slope
                + is green
                - is red

            for each TSL value (percent offset from current price) x in TSL_VALUES:

                determine the p/l for each section of the SMA trend (when it is with it, and when it is against it)

                    when the sma trend direction switches we have no idea how long its going to stay in this direction
                        if we don't invest in the beginning when it lasts a short time we avoid taking a loss
                        if we don't invest in the beginning when it lasts a long time we missed making a profit
                        if we do invest in the beginning when it lasts a short time we take a loss
                        if we do invest in the beginning when it lasts a long time we make a profit

                        if we choose a sma window that is really large and a tsl value that is really small relative
                        to the sma window, the sma trend will stay a long time

                        We could do a min abs(+/-) threshold of the sma slope > 0 to invest than
                        And just have it immediately invest
                        And just have it wait for the next tsl to trigger an investment
                        TRY BOTH


                plot 1: price, sma, trend, highlight when sign_of_sma_slope == sign_of_trend_slope, tsl_long, tsl_short
                plot 2: current p/l of tsl_long and tsl_short
                plot 3: total p/l of tsl_long, total p/l of tsl_short, net p/l

    Hopefully the profits made when the SMA is correct outway the losses when the SMA is wrong.
    I expect an x value significantly smaller than w will perform the best
    because we're trying to catch the volitility of a trend.

TO DO:

    make key for dct in NOTES.txt

    make test to verify that if you just switch back and forth between long and short tsl that it will take a loss
        
        investment_helper 1, 2, 4
        tsl_dct_helper 2

        So the back tests don't seem to be reliable.
        The backtest.py in ~/rooms/investing/tsls/sma_switch/backtest.py gets 86x returns
        This backtest is basically a SAR strategy but with SMA slope switching
        However the SAME price data yields a different result in ~/rooms/investing/sma-tsl-switch/tsl_test.py,
        even when the data is the same. I want to run it live with a small amount of money, however the likelihood
        of it profiting seems low. This is because I distinctly remember making a (pure) SAR strategy when I lived
        with my parents and it taking a loss. However when I recreated a SAR strat (today) it had positive returns
        in the backtest. This leads me to believe the backtest is flawed somehow (even though I've looked deeply
        into it and the math seems correct) ... this leads me to want to test it live (but with a small portfolio)
        to see if it can actually profit. However first I'm going to do a basic simulation of trading fake USD
        for actual crypto instead of doing percentages to see how/if it changes the annual profit.

        For when I do trade it live though ...

        I can't use Poloniex anymore so I probably need to use another
        Kraken looks good (allows US customers, has margin trading with 5x leverage, and 0.16% maker fee, 0.26% taker fee. source: https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000526126-What-are-Maker-and-Taker-fees-)
        Also check out Kraken Crypto Futures Exchange (50x leverage): https://www.kraken.com/en-us/features/futures ... could work for rebalancing method ... depending on what futures options are available to buy sell, you wouldn't even worry about price.

        also check out other exchanges
        Kraken's volume is probably good enough but ForEx has bigger volume (biggest in the world I think), also good leverage ... I just need to find a place to trade forex with:
        low trading fees (some might have 0%! because robinhood pushed it)
        allows US customers
        and allows margin trading
        has an API or some way to trade algorithmically

        Once an exchange is selected, you need to build/find a framework to connect to it and create a kraken-basic-setup repo (or whichever exchange basic-setup) that ideally has both live trading and back testing.

    put thing in useful_plotting_aid.py in this script
        make vertical line where cursor is
        put values of data (where cursor is at) in the legend itself
            this is require repositioning the legends to give them more room 
                ... and maybe making them basic text boxes instead of legends

    with the current const variables:
        we miss a large profit from a short
            this is because the short TSL was tracking
            but it started tracking before the SMA slope switched to negative
            ... so basically if we're not going to invest immediately when the
                sma slope switches (in this ex. switches to negative) we need to
                start tracking the opposite TSL (in this ex. a long TSL), so that
                way it gets triggered if theres a really long short

                    ... make it in a different file though

    then make backup_tsl_test2.py
        update description to explain different between first backup and 2nd
            1st backup has tsl constant on both sides
            2nd backup has tsls switching back and forth

    then make it so that investments are made in tandem with the sma
        and explain the difference between the tests

IDEA:

    for each window length back into time
    if there is a consistent level of volitility (aka std dev has low volitility (aka the std dev of the std dev))
    and there is a consistent slope (aka avg slope over a smaller window within this window is conistent (aka it has a low std dev))
        how long is it likely for this pattern of volitility and slope to continue?
        especially if the pattern is occuring withing a larger pattern that is with or against this micro pattern

        ... would be useful to test this one with 5 min data over maybe a month

    In the market there are people with different sized portfolios
    If someone who has large portolio goes long on an asset
    the ...

        ... Use bollinger bands!

        for w in WINDOW_SIZES:

            if standard deviation of the price is smooth and consistent
            (aka if the boolinger band's value hasn't changed that much over the timespan of the windows)
            (aka if the sum of the all the changes in volitility (aka change in standard deviation of the price)
            over the timespan of the window is close to zero ... )

            AND

            The the SMA slope is above a threshold of Y

                Then set a trailing stop loss at an x value of 2*pi (95 % chance it doesn't get triggered)

        Note:
            if Y is steep we'll be late to buy in
            if Y is shallow we'll take more losses
            The larger the slope the faster it will break
            if Y is zero
                this would then be a predictive algorithm
                    and trades would be made based off likelihoods, not


    what if the distance the next timestep's value is from the previous timesteps moving average the more exponential the weights will become.
    A difference of 0 from the previous moving average will weight them equally for a simple moving average, but a large distance will make the
    weights very exponential. The equation for could be:

            w[i] = t[i] ^ (1 + d)

            d = absolute value of percentage distance of current timestep's price from previous timestep's moving average
                    this value will vary from 0.00 to 1.00

        ... this could yeild an SMA that doesn't lag !!!

        ... or not, the lag is what makes it useful in the first place because it smooths out the smaller scale volitility
